       "' \\n    My first test was checking that cards were being drawn from the deck correctly. What I\\n    expected for this was for a card to end up in the hand and for that card to not be in the\\n    deck anymore, according to the getCard() function. To test this, I checked that the card in the\\n    hand was not in the deck list. If it was, then I returned False (indicating failure). \\n    Otherwise, I returned True. This was successful, so I moved on to my second test. \\n    \\n    My second test was to check that sets were being laid down once they were encountered in the\\n    hand and then removed from the hand. To test this, I made a deck that only included a set of 4\\n    cards of the same rank then invoked the drawCard() function 4 times to get all 4 of those cards\\n    in the hand. If the hand was not empty, then I returned False to indicate failure and printed\\n    the hand to verify. Otherwise, I returned True. When running this test, I encountered a failure.\\n    In order to debug this, I used the embed() function right before the line where I expected the \\n    set handling to occur. Once I got this running, I printed the hand to see what was currently \\n    drawn. At the moment, there were only 2 cards in the hand, which was expected at this point\\n    in the code. I decided to make sure the next line (which was important for handling a set) was\\n    as expected. The condition was to check if length of hand was 4. I printed out len(hand), and\\n    expected to get 2. When I got 1, I realized that the size of hand was 1 because it was a \\n    dictionary. Only one rank was in the hand, but 2 SUITS were in the hand. Therefore, I printed\\n    len(hand[cardRank]) to see if I got 2 as expected, since we had 2 SUITS. When I did this, I got\\n    2 as expected for the output. After this, I changed the code to incorporate this change and then\\n    ran test 1 and test 2 again and got True and saw that the line printed to indicate sets being \\n    laid out was on the console for the rank I put in the initial deck. After this, I moved on to \\n    the third test.\\n    \\n    My third test was to check test 2 but with a full deck and that ALL sets were laid out\\n    successfully - that the program was able to go through a full run through successfully. I invoked\\n    the drawCard() function 52 times and made sure the hand was empty after this. If this was not\\n    true, then I returned False to indicate failure. Otherwise, I returned True to indicate success.\\n    I got True and also saw that the line printed to indicate sets being laid out was on the console,\\n    so this helped me verify my bug fix worked.\\n'"
